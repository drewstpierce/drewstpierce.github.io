      <h5><p>Following the success of 2008’s <em>Persona 4</em>, the Persona team shoves their way into a generation of HD gaming with a bang. Sure, they’re a little late, but it’s obvious that they’ve taken notes on the current gen., knowing exactly which paradigms to use, avoid, and parody. You might say this makes Catherine a postmodern title, one that exists because of gaming’s current state of formulaic monotony and the fact that video games, strangely enough, are becoming more artistically inclined as the medium evolves. Catherine is (arguably) what games have been leading up to for the last thirty years. It’s a conglomerate of genres we should be all familiar with, from veterans of the arcade days to less experienced gamers. But is it for everybody? Well, it’s not for the kiddies.</p>
        <p>The most exploited aspect of Catherine is the adult nature of the story, which Atlus’s marketing team has drenched with sexual innuendo and half-nakedness. Advertisements and trailers might convey something along the lines of a <em>Leisure Suit Larry</em> title, but the game’s adult nature simply comes from the fact that the story is based on the chaos of adulthood—the complexity of relationships dealing with the opposite sex while still maintaining one’s identity. Sure, sexuality is an overt theme in Catherine, but I’ve yet to meet an adult who can say that sexuality isn’t a theme in their everyday life. I guess what I’m trying to convey is that you shouldn’t expect a gaming experience on the level of <em>Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball.</em></p>
        <p>You play as Vincent, a 32-year-old male who has yet to settle into the familial structure expected by western societal norms. You know—a wife, kids, a white-collar job, owning land—general adult responsibilities. Vincent’s girlfriend of five years, Katherine (not the same as Catherine), is overt in expressing her anticipation for the American dream lifestyle. Commitment scares the crap out of poor Vincent, leading him down a path of weeknight drunkenness and weekly cartons of cigarettes at his favorite bar, Stray Sheep. One night, after having the “marriage talk” with Katherine and pounding one too many High Lifes, our hero slips up and brings Catherine along to his bachelor pad. Catherine is a sexy young blonde with an appetite for, um, how do you say… the kinky stuff. Who could blame poor Vincent? Or who <em>couldn’t</em> blame the son of a bitch? Either way, all hell breaks loose and thus begins a cerebral delve into the unconscious mind of a cheater, or a guy who just made a mistake, as Vincent’s exterior life forces him into a nightmare world full of guilt’s most terrifying manifestations. If you’re familiar with the works of David Lynch or Philip K. Dick, <em>Catherine</em>’s story is right up your alley.</p>        
        <p>Catherine is a very cinematic game, but not in the vein of <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em>’s move-gameplay-movie-gameplay pattern of storytelling. The anime style cutscenes are frequent, but shorter than most of today’s story laden titles. Due to the title’s beautifully crafted HD in-game presentation, cutscenes smoothly merge with the life-sim gameplay, as the plot unfolds without cutting to excessive bouts of dialogue and animation devoid of player interaction. Instead, the player takes part in the story’s development. It doesn’t sound like anything new, but believe me, it brings gamers closer to an interactive movie than any other title claiming to do so. At first glance, the “life-sim” gameplay appears somewhat linear. At the previously mentioned Stray Sheep bar, you allow Vincent to do exactly what one might expect to do in a bar—talk with friends, watch the news, text message, and drink until your heart stops. Sounds pretty boring, but it’s actually quite interesting. <em>Catherine</em>’s text messaging feature puts an interesting twist on the life-sim’s non-linear progression. While hanging with friends, Vincent receives messages from various characters, such as his girlfriend Katherine, who constantly berates him for spending so much time in the bar (pretty realistic, considering my own experience). You can reply to these texts, choosing from a wide-variety of responses to convey a variety of attitudes and behaviors. Interestingly enough, these seemingly marginal choices can alter the outcome of a night at the pub. For example, while trying to avoid Catherine after Vincent’s slip up, I received a text message from the vixen asking if she could join me at the bar. I lied, told her to buzz off, and went back to an interesting dialogue between a barfly and Vincent. Guess who decides to show up—the blonde home wrecker. This made for some very awkward moments, and greatly impacted my morality meter (a very Bioware influenced good/bad meter that effects the game’s outcome) with each dialogue decision. Later, after dying a thousand times on the second boss fight, I returned to my last save, the moment right before receiving Catherine’s text. Once received, I ignored it, figuring I should hurry to the boss battle. On my way out, Catherine sat alone at a table with her back facing me, giving me an opportunity to slip out without screwing up my morality meter. The subtle ability to control situations without simply answering patterns of questions with certain answers makes the life-sim portion of <em>Catherine</em> intriguingly different from other games dependent on the player’s decisions. Even though I’ve only cited a brief example of this aspect of the game, it’s obvious that there’s different experience for everyone, more options than the “I chose light side/I chose dark side” paradigm, which definitely adds to the game’s replay value.</p>
        <p>Hardcore gamers (I’m not talking about you guys with <em>Gears of War </em>tattoos) will be more than pleased with the complexity <em>Catherine</em>’s gameplay has to offer. There’s definitely something here for casual gamers simply looking for a great story—however, members of this demographic will definitely want to experience the game on easy mode. I can honestly say that I haven’t wanted to chuck a controller so many times since 2009’s <em>Demon’s Souls</em>. And that’s saying a lot. In the nightmare world, Vincent is forced to complete 8 tiers of puzzle hell. If he dies in the dream, he dies in reality (that’s what happens to cheaters, folks). To prevent this, you control Vincent on a mountain of blocks similar to the layout of <em>Q*bert</em>, if anyone remembers that far back. You organize the block into various patters to reach the exit at the top. Simple, right? Throw in the fact that time hates every fiber of your being, and you’ve got one of the most challenging puzzle titles to date. As you progress upward, the blocks below you fall into oblivion. If you don’t work fast, so does Vincent, and you’re forced to retry until you run out of continues. The boss battles are mind numbingly difficult for the first few hundred attempts. Vincent’s interpretations of his exterior life manifest into demons that the player must outrun while forming the pathway to the exit. They’re fast, which means you better be on your toes if you wish to succeed. However, pay attention to the techniques shared by NPC sheep characters hanging around the nightmare-world’s save points and you’ll prevail. Despite the frustration, there’s nothing more rewarding than finishing a boss battle that seemed impossible five hundred tries before. I expect that this aspect of <em>Catherine</em> will receive some hefty praise from fans of old school arcade titles like <em>Donkey Kong</em> and <em>Gallaga</em>. Simply put, the puzzles are fun and challenging, but sometimes get in the way of enjoying the story. I definitely regret choosing the medium difficulty for my first play through. If video game frustrations easily set into rage mode, be careful with <em>Catherine</em>.</p> 
        <p>Another small but entertaining quirk is the game’s confessional booth. Inbetween levels, Vincent gets to take a seat in a confessional booth, one that Catholic gamers will find familiar. For each session, Vincent, or rather the player is asked a question based on his/her own morality and judgment, often relevant to past or current aspects of romantic history. The answers will directly affect the morality meter, but if your system has online connectivity, they’re thrown into a pool other players’ answers, resulting in a pie chart to show exactly how morally diverse <em>Catherine</em>’s audience is. It’s surprising to see how many other Atlus fanboys have cheated on a significant other. Don’t worry; it’s anonymous as far as I can tell. This seemingly menial feature is a sort of parody of gaming’s obsession with online connectivity, the trophies and awards shared within a competitive social network. What was once an entertaining hobby is now part of our electric history, just like status updates and tweets. So why should a game based on the intimate details of a player’s life be any different? It’s still a game, so we must want our friends to see how high we’ve scored. Or how many times we’ve scored. Thankfully, as I said before, it’s anonymous. Just take it as a little gesture illustrating the game’s self-awareness in a time when even electronic entertainment is storming the privacy fence.</p>
        <p><em>Catherine</em> is a very weird game. It’s unlike anything you’ve ever played; yet the eclectic influence of gaming’s previous and current generations is constant throughout. It’s a strange mish-mash of everything we enjoy about videogames, but the result is completely original. <em>Catherine </em>might appear to be another one of Atlus’s obscure titles belonging to a fan base of anime and JRPG addicts, but it’s not. In a way, it’s a gamer’s game—something for the “hardcore” gamer without genre limits or a midnight curfew. It’s a title for those who simply enjoy everything about the medium of digital entertainment, but have become bored with the standard cash-cow formulas used to fuel the cloning process. If this is you, you’ll be glad to see a developer actually <em>develop</em> these standards, creating an enjoyable challenge and a mind-job of a plot. Think of it as a reward for those who’ve sat through the same game with different box art time and time again. <em>Catherine </em>may not change the face of gaming, but it brings enough innovation to the table that you’ll wish it would. So give it a try. Just don’t forget about the easy mode.</p></h5>
